# news
This app is for demo using The Guardian API.

It contains HomeActivity with tab layout on the top. Which can be used to swipe and switch to different categories of news.
On clicking the news item you can read the full article.

#### Features:
* 10 different category of news
* uses ViewModel to store UI during configuration changes
* custom chrome tabs for fast and easy inbuilt web view
* async tasks to get the data on seperate thread.


#### Improvements required:
* using multiple fragments on single activity with model view to save data coming to recycler view has made the system `quite slow.`
* imporvement can be done using activity for different categories of news instead of fragments.
* This is an experimental demo hence menu buttons and side navigations for different settings are not included.
* This app is best designed only for 6 inches smart phones.
